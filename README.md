Hi, welcome to my Contacts App. This application is my first full stack MERN application. The frontend of the application is deployed to Netlify, while the backend of the application is deployed to Herku. As the name implies this application is your typical contacts app, allowing you to create, edit, delete, retrive and search for contacts.
